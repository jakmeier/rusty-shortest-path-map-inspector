# rusty-shortest-path-map-inspector
Generates a visual representation for *.jkmmap files. To open a *.jkmmap file, simply give its path as an argument to the inspector.
These files  are generated by the shortest path map tester module as log files.

The only purpose of this module is to make dubugging the shortest-path-map module easier.

The running program will look something like this:

<img src="./img/example.png" width="500" />

The red circles are the nodes used by the internal graph to find the correct shortest paths. The black lines between them are the edges of the graph and are only present when the path is not blocked by obstacles. The obstacles are displayed in blue and transparent. This helps to see where obstacles overlap each other. 

The green points mark the direction of the shortest path from a node onwards. The destination node has no shortest path, therefore its green point is in the center of the red circle.

In case the map border is blocking, it will not be visible through the inspector. In fact, the information is not even stored in the log file. Therefore, nodes outside of tha map sometimes look like they could be connected to the graph when in fact they cannot. The inspector will show those nodes unconnected to the main graph and mark the shortest path as not existing by putting the green point in the center of the node.
