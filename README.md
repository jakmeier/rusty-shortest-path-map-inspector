# rusty-shortest-path-map-inspector
Generates a visual representation for *.jkmmap files. 
These files  are generated by the shortest path map tester module as log files.

The running program will look something like this:

<img src="./img/example.png" width="500" />

To open a *.jkmmap file, simply give its path as an argument to the inspector.

The only purpose of this module is to make dubugging the shortest-path-map module easier.
